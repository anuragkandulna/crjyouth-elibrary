# Digital Library Management (WIP)

This project is actually a trimmed down version of an actual full-stack app. A whole lot of propitary IP has been removed. 

Live demo version is deployed in a VPS environment: (TODO: Link to project)  

Here are some of the features original project has (some of these will be added later):
1. Library asset management across multiple branches
2. User Referral programme
3. AI based chat support system
4. Monthly Trivia
5. News feed system
